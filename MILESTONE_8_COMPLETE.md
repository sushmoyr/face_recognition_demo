## 🚀 Validation Commands

### Database Migration
```bash
mvn -pl backend flyway:migrate
```

### Configuration Encryption Setup
```bash
# Generate encryption credentials
python scripts/config_encrypt.py generate-salt

# Encrypt RTSP URL
python scripts/config_encrypt.py encrypt-rtsp "rtsp://admin:pass@camera.local/stream"

# Generate encrypted environment
python scripts/config_encrypt.py env-encrypt --output .env.encrypted
```

### Deduplication Testing
```bash
# Test duplicate recognition handling
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/recognitions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EDGE_TOKEN" \
  -d @test-recognition.json

# Verify duplicate returns DUPLICATE status
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/recognitions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EDGE_TOKEN" \
  -d @test-recognition.json
```
